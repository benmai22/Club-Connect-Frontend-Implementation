# Club-Connect-Frontend-Implementation
Attached is my Frontend Implementation for this app using React Native and Javascript. I believe that there is still much to improve, but at where I am at, users are able to successfully navigate around the UI from various pages such as the Login Page, Sign up Page, Home Page, Directory Page, News Page, and even the Profile Page. The Home page is where users are able to view events they are subscribed to. The Directory page shows events that are posted on the backend that they can subscribe to if they want. Also, the News tab is where users can view upcoming events on the calendar. The profile page showcases the user photo and options where they can access pages like changing account information, uploading event, or even logout of their account. I used a UI library which is why the implementation isn't as smooth as it should be, but I am going to spend more time to work on it as time goes by. 


Progress as of 11/6/2020:
